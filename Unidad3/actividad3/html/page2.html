                <h1>What's nu metal?</h1>
                <p>Nu metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The term "nu metal" is a portmanteau of "new metal," which was used to describe the genre's fusion of metal, hip-hop, and alternative rock. Nu metal is characterized by heavy, down-tuned guitars, rapped or spoken vocals, and electronic elements such as samples and turntables.\
                    <br>
                    Nu metal emerged in the mid-1990s as a response to the dominance of grunge and alternative rock. The first bands to be classified as nu metal were Korn, Deftones, and Tool. These bands combined the heavy, riff-based sound of metal with the attitude and aesthetics of alternative rock.
                    <br>
                    The genre's breakthrough came in 1998 with the release of Korn's third album, "Follow the Leader." The album featured the hit single "Freak on a Leash," which featured Jonathan Davis's signature vocal style of alternating between singing and rapping. The album sold over 10 million copies and helped to popularize nu metal.
                    <br>
                    Nu metal continued to gain popularity throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. Bands like Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, and System of a Down achieved mainstream success with their unique takes on the genre. Limp Bizkit, in particular, became one of the biggest bands in the world with their 2000 album "Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water."
                    <br>
                    Despite its commercial success, nu metal was often criticized for its simplistic lyrics and reliance on formulaic song structures. The genre was also accused of being overly commercial and pandering to the lowest common denominator.
                    <br>
                    By the mid-2000s, nu metal's popularity began to wane. Many of the genre's biggest bands either disbanded or shifted towards different styles of music. However, nu metal's influence can still be heard in contemporary metal and alternative rock. Bands like Bring Me the Horizon, Code Orange, and Deafheaven incorporate elements of nu metal into their music.

                <p>
                    While it incorporates elements of traditional metal, nu metal is distinguished by a unique blend of sounds that set it apart from other metal genres. Here are some key characteristics that make nu metal special:

                    <h1>Linkin Park</h1>
                    <br>

                        Linkin Park is a band that has made a significant impact on the nu metal genre. The band emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a pioneer of the genre, blending elements of heavy metal, alternative rock, and hip-hop to create a unique sound that resonated with fans around the world.
                        <br>
                        The band's debut album, "Hybrid Theory," released in 2000, was a commercial and critical success, selling over 10 million copies in the United States alone. The album's blend of heavy riffs, rap verses, and melodic hooks, combined with its emotionally charged lyrics, struck a chord with fans and established Linkin Park as one of the leading bands of the nu metal movement.
                        <br>
                        Linkin Park's impact on nu metal can be seen in several ways. First, the band's unique sound, which blended multiple genres, paved the way for other bands to experiment with different sounds and styles. Many nu metal bands that emerged in the early 2000s drew inspiration from Linkin Park's hybrid approach, incorporating elements of rap, electronic music, and alternative rock into their own music.
                        <br>
                        Second, Linkin Park's lyrics, which dealt with themes of alienation, anger, and depression, resonated with a generation of fans who were struggling to find their place in the world. The band's emotional honesty and vulnerability helped to establish a new standard for authenticity in the nu metal genre, inspiring other bands to write more personal and introspective lyrics.
                        <br>
                        Third, Linkin Park's success in the mainstream helped to bring nu metal to a wider audience. The band's ability to blend heavy riffs with catchy melodies and accessible lyrics helped to make nu metal more palatable to a mainstream audience that might not have been interested in more traditional metal.
                        <br>
                        Overall, Linkin Park's impact on nu metal cannot be overstated. The band's unique sound, emotionally charged lyrics, and mainstream appeal helped to establish nu metal as a significant genre of rock music in the early 2000s, and their influence can still be felt in the music of many nu metal bands today.

                        <br>
                        Korn's impact on nu metal can be seen in several ways. First, the band's use of heavy, downtuned guitars and aggressive rhythms helped to define the sound of nu metal. Korn's music was darker and more intense than many of the other popular rock bands of the time, and their use of hip-hop-inspired beats and electronic elements helped to set them apart from other metal bands.
                        <br>
                        Second, Korn's emotionally charged lyrics, which dealt with themes of anger, frustration, and alienation, struck a chord with a generation of fans who were struggling to find their place in the world. The band's raw honesty and vulnerability helped to establish a new standard for authenticity in the nu metal genre, inspiring other bands to write more personal and introspective lyrics.
                        <br>

                        Second, System of a Down's lyrics, which dealt with political and social issues, helped to establish a new standard of intellectualism in the nu metal genre. The band's socially conscious themes and sharp critiques of politics and society helped to inspire a new generation of politically engaged rock musicians.
